# Native Ice Phishing Bot

## Description

This bot monitors:

- Transactions where the receiver is either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a suspicious contract, and the input data is the hash of a known function signature.
- When a suspicious EOA receives native tokens from a number of different EOAs that exceeds a certain threshold.
- When a contract is deployed with characteristics indicative of a potential native ice phishing attack.

## Supported Chains

- Ethereum
- Arbitrum
- Avalanche
- BNB Smart Chain
- Fantom
- Optimism
- Polygon
